2. **White background** - makes products stand out
3. **Good lighting** - show product details clearly
4. **Multiple angles** - you can upload multiple products with different angles
5. **Compress large images** - use https://tinypng.com before upload

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### **"Upload failed" error:**
- Check internet connection
- Try smaller image (compress it)
- Use "Use URL" tab and upload to ImgBB.com manually

### **Image not showing:**
- Wait 10 seconds and refresh page
- Check if URL is valid (open in new tab)
- Try uploading again

### **Slow upload:**
